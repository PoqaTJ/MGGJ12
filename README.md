https://itch.io/jam/magical-girl-game-jam-12

### Theme
Probably "Rising"

### Docs
GDD, TDD eventually

## Developers

### Tools
[Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) (download the latest version)
Unity 6000.1.15f1
Modeling/animations: Blender (Version tbd)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository using the git client of your choice. I recommend Github Desktop.
2. In Unity Hub, Projects>Add>Add Project from Disk.
3. Select the folder you cloned the repository into. It should contain Assets/, ProjectSettings/, etc.

### Contributing
You won't be able to commit directly to the `main` branch. Create a branch (I recommend using initials, like `tj/new_feature`), then create a PR into `main`.
